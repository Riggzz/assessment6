my testing process consists of testing all the buttons and playing a full round of Deul Duo

bugs-
see all bots does nothing when you click on it
everytime i win the losess counter increases but the wins counter stays at 0

after looking in the terminal a common error im getting is botsArr is not defined
possibly check there
